<body>
	<p>Welcome to my Experimental page.  I am currently enrolled in UCSD's Web Development programming learning full-stack.  We're still early in the class, so there isn't much to post here.  As I get learn more, this page will update.</p>
	<p>The primary purpose of this page is to try things out.  When they're good, I'll merge them into the main branch.</p>
